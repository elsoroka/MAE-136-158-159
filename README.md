# Professor Liebeck's Notes, Digital Edition

This is a digital conversion of Professor Liebeck's notes for MAE 136 and, eventually, MAE 158 and 159. All content, equations, and figures are exactly as they appear in the original document(s), which are posted on the MAE 136/158/159 class websites.

*Q: Where is the original PDF?*

*A: On the MAE 136 class website, and likely elsewhere on the Internet.*

*Q: Where are the notes for MAE 158 / 159?*

*A: The notes for 158 and 159 will be ported as the year continues.*

## How to compile your PDF
You will need a LaTeX editor. Many free options are available. I like TeXStudio, although if you only need to compile this one document you can go with a lightweight option such as TeXWorks

1. Download the repository. You want the main.tex and Figures folder. Make sure to preserve the file structure - e.g. main.tex and Figures/ should be in the same directory.
2. Open main.tex in your favorite editor and compile. (If you are very new to LaTeX, there is usually a "Compile" button - look for that.)
3. Your output should be the PDF.

*Q: Why didn't you just post a PDF?*

*A: Because you should learn LaTeX.*

### Why do we need this?

The original files suffer from a few issues:
1. There are no page numbers. It is difficult to follow along in lecture.
2. The contents are not indexed. Students cannot find the content they need to study.
3. Because the original PDF was handwritten, it is not searchable. Again, it's difficult for students to navigate.

This new edition contains the exact same content as the original handwritten PDF, but in a typeset format which introduces:
1. A hyperlinked table of contents
2. Equation and figure numbers with hyperlinks
3. Ability to search for a term or phrase

Eventually, we may introduce:
1. An index
2. A symbol table defining all variables

*Q: Can you add _____?*

*A: Please suggest it! The goal of this conversion is to make the information in Professor Liebeck's notes more accessible.*


### The content of this document...
Is entirely from Professor Liebeck's notes for his MAE 136 class. All text, equations, and figures are from this document.
This conversion is provided as-is. There may be errors in transcribing Liebeck's notes. (If you catch one, please report it!)

### This is not official
I am not working on behalf of UCI. I decided to typset these notes because the original format was difficult for me to study with.
